The handbreak physical assets are based off this video:
For assembly i recommend watching this video:

You can purchase his other cad components here:

I really liked this guys guide however I had a few issues with it;
1) He didnt release the CAD file, and therefore you cant edit it and make minor changes :( 
2) I didnt like his cabling solution - so i ran mine out the side 
3) The assets he linked werent readily avaiable in my area - 
4) I wanted to buy all the gear from bunnings warehouse and JayCar (the greatest establishments in all of Sydney, Australia)
This model is just the base, I use his STL files for the handbreak cover, lever, lever spacers & pot holder - All avaiable on the cults 3d above (Given its now paid i wont attach the STL files (as at July 23))

Still buy the same Bolts and Nuts:
M5 bolt - 2x 70mm
M5 bolt - 30mm
M5 Nut - 8x
M10 bolt - 100mm
M10 bolt - 75mm
M10 Nut - 3x

100mm sompression Spring; Varying strength based off use case.
If you want to do more drift maybe slightly less, if you want to rally i recommend a bit stronger.
