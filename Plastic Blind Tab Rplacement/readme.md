I keep getting annoyed with the plastic blind holders in my flat breaking.
This should be a $2c part but australian real-estate agents think theyre worth $100 

I printed 50 of these so when they break im in the clear.
Now you can be too!

Modify the .scad file to fit the dimensions of your blind holder!

enjoy :P
